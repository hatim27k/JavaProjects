The `@Bean` annotation in Spring Framework (and by extension, Spring Boot) is a fundamental annotation used to declare that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container.

Here's a breakdown of what it means and why it's used in the context of the example:

### What `@Bean` does:

1.  **Method Level Annotation:** `@Bean` is applied to methods within a class annotated with `@Configuration` (or implicitly by `@SpringBootApplication` which includes `@Configuration`).
2.  **Bean Creation:** When Spring processes a `@Configuration` class, it invokes all methods annotated with `@Bean`. The object returned by such a method is then registered as a bean in the Spring application context.
3.  **Spring Container Management:** Once a method's return value is registered as a bean, Spring's IoC container manages its lifecycle (creation, dependency injection, destruction, etc.). Other components can then `@Autowired` or `inject` this bean without needing to manually instantiate it.
4.  **Dependency Injection within `@Configuration`:** Methods annotated with `@Bean` can have parameters that are themselves beans already managed by the Spring container. Spring will automatically inject these dependencies when calling the `@Bean` method.

### Why it's used in the `MybatisAppApplication.java` example:

In the `MybatisAppApplication.java` file, you saw this code:

```java
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean; // <--- Here it is
import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;

@SpringBootApplication
public class MybatisAppApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(MybatisAppApplication.class, args);
    }

    @Bean // <--- The annotation is here
    public CommandLineRunner initDatabase(JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate) {
        return args -> {
            jdbcTemplate.execute("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;");
            jdbcTemplate.execute("CREATE TABLE users (" +
                                 "id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY," +
                                 "name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL," +
                                 "email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE" +
                                 ");");
            System.out.println("User table created successfully!");
        };
    }
}
```

Here, the `initDatabase` method is annotated with `@Bean`. This tells Spring Boot:

1.  **"Create an instance of `CommandLineRunner`":** The `initDatabase` method returns an anonymous implementation of the `CommandLineRunner` interface.
2.  **"Manage this instance as a Spring Bean":** Spring will add this `CommandLineRunner` object to its context.
3.  **"Execute it after startup":** Any `CommandLineRunner` bean found by Spring Boot will have its `run()` method automatically invoked once the application context is fully loaded. This is a common way to execute initialization tasks (like database schema creation or data loading) right after your application starts.
4.  **"Inject `JdbcTemplate`":** The `initDatabase` method takes `JdbcTemplate` as a parameter. Spring automatically provides an instance of `JdbcTemplate` (which it has already configured based on your `application.properties` datasource) to this method when it calls `initDatabase` to create the `CommandLineRunner` bean.

In essence, `@Bean` allows you to define programmatic components whose lifecycle and dependencies are managed by Spring, making your application modular, testable, and easy to configure.
